This repository contains the code for first-arrival adjoint tomography developed by Xiaole Zhou.

ðŸ”§ Development History
Forward modeling of the eikonal equation was developed during Xiaole Zhou's PhD at IGGCAS, under the supervision of Haiqiang Lan.

Adjoint-state inversion, based on the SEISCOPE optimization toolbox, was developed during his visit to CNRS GEOAZUR, under the supervision of StÃ©phane Operto and Haiqiang Lan.

Double-difference measurement capability was developed during his postdoctoral research at NTU, under the supervision of Ping Tong and Xunchang Fei.
